# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Project

Welcome to the **AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Project** repository. This project aims to provide actionable insights into the operations, revenue, and guest behavior of AtliQ Grands, a chain of luxury hotels, to address declining market share and revenue losses.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands, a leading five-star hotel chain in India with over 20 years in the hospitality industry, has been facing challenges due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making. These issues have resulted in a loss of market share and declining revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. To combat this, AtliQ Grands aims to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** to regain market share and improve revenue streams.
